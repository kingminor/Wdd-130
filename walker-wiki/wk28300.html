                <p>
                    Lily Cadieux (Walker #28300) is likely the most important character in the World of Walker saga. As an archaeologist and co-founder 
                    of the 
                    Modern Walker Network, her dedication and passion for archeology has profoundly shaped the series' events and laid the groundwork 
                    for the resistance. <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2015, Lily made a historic discovery, unearthing evidence of the advanced Walker civilization that thrived thousands of years ago.
                     She also found the time capsules left by these ancient Walkers, each containing critical knowledge for the future. Her work exposed 
                     the ambitions of Red Nexus, a powerful tech organization with plans to reverse-engineer and weaponize this technology. To counteract 
                     Red Nexus, Lily joined forces with Walkers #0 and #22, creating the Modern Walker Network as a community of individuals dedicated 
                     to protecting this knowledge and countering the Red Nexus threat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Through her research, Lily deciphered a key revelation within the time capsules: a warning of a solar storm set to strike Earth in 
                    2030, an event with the potential to destabilize civilization. Lily's role became vital as she and the Network mobilized to prepare 
                    for the storm and its aftermath. However, just before the storm hit, she was captured by Red Nexus. Details of her eventual escape
                    after the storm remain unknown.

            <h2>Discovery of the Ancient Walkers</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; We first learn of Lily Cadiuex as a passionate archaeology student at a French university, dedicating her free time to researching “Out of Place Artifacts”—objects that 
                seemed too advanced for their historical time periods. Through her research, she developed a theory about an ancient civilization dating back to around 1000 BC. However, her 
                professors largely dismissed this idea as implausible. Undeterred, Lily embarked on fieldwork to find evidence supporting her hypothesis. <br>
                <br>
                &emsp; Her breakthrough came with the discovery of a unique stone formation found in eight locations around the world, including one site in northern France. When these 
                locations were connected on a map, they formed a shape resembling the Alan Walker logo. While visiting the site in France, Lily proved the connection between these 
                stone formations and the theory of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization. She returned to her university with this new evidence, ultimately convincing her 
                professors to lead an excavation at the site in northern France. The excavation uncovered compelling proof of the Ancient Walker civilization, propelling Lily into
                global fame.

            <h2>Continued Work & Gaining Funding</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; After her discovery of the Ancient Walkers, Lily focused on learning more about their civilization, including analyzing artifacts and mapping potential sites. 
                This research required significant resources. <a href="red-nexus.html">Red Nexus</a>, a major technology company, offered to sponsor her work. With Red Nexus's support, Lily expanded her operations. 
                As part of the agreement, Red Nexus opened a museum called the Walker Excavations, which displayed many of the artifacts found during the excavations. After awhile
                lily stared noticing Irregularities between her work and what was displayed at the Excavations Museum. In addition, several of her former coleagues suddenly disappeared.
                Fearing the worst, she quietly ended her collaboration with the company and continued her work in secret. She also officialy formed the Modern Walker Network, a group
                dedicated to decrypting the messages left by the Ancient Walkers and hiding these discoveries from red nexus.

            <h2>Exploring Son Doong Cavern</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; Lily discovered the Ancient Walker's Main City deep in the jungles of modern-day Vietnam, a region previously overlooked by archaeologists. This area hadn't received major
                archaeological research due to the tough conditions and the presumed un-importance of the region. Lily discovered this secret using chemicals to reveal the map hidden
                in one of the paintings at the walker-excavations. Using this information, she traveled to Son Doong Cave in vietnam where a local agreed to guide her through the cave.
                As they ventured into the cave, they found many items relating to the Ancient Walkers. Eventual she came across a massive prophecy disk located inside a portion of the 
                cave open to the sunlight. This contained many details about future events.

            <h2>The Ancient Walker's Warning!</h2>
            <p>
                One of Lily Cadieux's most critical contributions to the World of Walker saga was her discovery of the ancient Walker civilization's dire warning about a solar storm 
                destined to strike Earth in 2030. During her continued analysis of the prophecy discs and other artifacts, Lily uncovered detailed engravings left by the ancient 
                Walkers, predicting catastrophic solar activity. These inscriptions described a massive solar storm (later named Eleanor) capable of disrupting global power grids, communications, and 
                society itself. Determined to prepare humanity for this looming threat, Lily and the Modern Walker Network devised a plan to mobilize resources to prepare for the solar 
                storm.

            <h2>Red Nexus Interviens</h2>
            <p>
                While preparing for the solar storm, she discovered that the Red Nexus has been quietly reverse engineering the technology found in the research and using it to build 
                militarized combat drones ("Called the <a href="rx-8.html">RX-8</a>"). Fearing what these drones could do, she tried to warn the 
                Modern Walkers. Unfortunately she was captured by Red Nexus before she could. However, thanks to the works of <a href="wk22.html">Walker #22</a>, who managed
                to infiltrate the Red Nexus's compound, they were able to get the information. Which she had writen on the walls of a safe house using luminescent paint before her capture.
                While we know lily escapes from Red Nexus somehow, details about the escape are unknown.
