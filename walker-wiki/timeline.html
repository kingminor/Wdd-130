            <h1>The Timeline</h1>
            <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of the World of Walker Universe is its timeline! Because the music videos were not released in 
                chronological order, piecing together the sequence of events can be a challenge. Newer videos often explore events that occurred long 
                before older ones, adding to the complexity of the story. This is the definitive unofficial timeline to help you navigate the eras of 
                this fascinating universe. <br><br>
                The World of Walker Timeline is divided into four major Eras, each representing a significant chapter in its rich history:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The Ancient Era (~1000 BC) </li>
                <li> The Modern Era (2015-2030) </li>
                <li>The Dark Era (2030-2090) </li>
                <li>The Future Era (2090-onward) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br>
                Each of these Eras has many important events and characters that add to the meaning of the story. Let's Dive Into It Together.

                <p>The ancient era in the World of Walker lore marks the origin of the storyline, dating back 3,000 years to a highly advanced 
                    civilization called the Walkers (now referred to as the Ancient Walkers). Located in the dense jungles of Vietnam, this 
                    society possessed groundbreaking technology, including the AVI-8 drones and the Spectre, a tool capable of predicting 
                    catastrophic events.

                    The Ancient Walkers used <a href="#">The Spectre</a> to discover two world-changing events. The first was a meteor storm that 
                    would soon destroy their civilization. The second was a massive <a href="events-eleanor.html">solar storm</a> that would 
                    devastate technology for a future civilization—our modern era.

                    Knowing their end was near, they dedicated nearly all their resources to creating time capsules that would preserve their 
                    knowledge and technology. These capsules included two main gifts for future civilizations: the AVI-8 drones and a prophecy 
                    disk. The disks contained messages warning of the dark future to come. In the end, they created eight time capsules and 
                    buried them at locations around the world.

                    The foretold meteor storm arrived, filling the sky with fire. Many Ancient Walkers sought shelter inside Son Doong Cavern. 
                    While most perished in the disaster, a few survived to tell stories of this ancient civilization.

                <h2>Lily's Discovery</h2>
                <h3>2015</h3>
                <p><a href="wk28300.html">Lily Cadiuex</a> emerged as a dedicated archaeology student at a renowned French university, where her interest in “Out of Place 
                    Artifacts” set her apart. These enigmatic objects, seemingly too advanced for their historical periods, inspired her to propose 
                    a bold theory: the existence of an advanced civilization from around 1000 BC. Though her peers and professors dismissed her ideas 
                    as speculative, she remained undeterred, channeling her energy into fieldwork in pursuit of evidence.

                <h2>The Discovery of Stone Formations</h2>
                <h3>2015</h3>
                <p>
                    Her determination culminated in the discovery of a series of unusual stone formations at eight locations across the globe, 
                    including one in northern France. When plotted on a map, these sites revealed a pattern resembling the Alan Walker logo. This 
                    breakthrough not only lent credence to her hypothesis but also connected the formations to an ancient, technologically advanced 
                    civilization.

                <h3>2015</h3>
                <p>
                    Armed with compelling findings, she persuaded her university to lead an excavation in northern France. The resulting excavation 
                    unearthed artifacts and structures that rewrote the historical narrative, substantiating the existence of the Ancient Walker 
                    civilization. This discovery propelled Cadiuex into international prominence, establishing her as a pivotal figure in the 
                    exploration of humanity's forgotten past.

                    Following the discovery of the Ancient Walker sites, Lily Cadiuex's groundbreaking research attracted the attention of Red Nexus, 
                    a prominent tech corporation. Eager to capitalize on the historical significance of her findings, Red Nexus offered to fund her 
                    ongoing excavations. With their financial backing, Lily gained access to advanced equipment and the resources necessary to expand 
                    her research, uncovering even more artifacts that hinted at the sophistication of the Ancient Walker civilization.
