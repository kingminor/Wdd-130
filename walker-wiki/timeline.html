            <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of the World of Walker Universe is its timeline! Because the music videos were not released in 
                chronological order, piecing together the sequence of events can be a challenge. Newer videos often explore events that occurred long

                this fascinating universe. <br><br>
                The World of Walker Timeline is divided into four major Eras, each representing a significant chapter in its rich history:<br>

                always finds a way to change the world; <br>
