            <h1>The Timeline</h1>
            <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of the World of Walker Universe is its timeline! Because the music videos were not released in 
                chronological order, piecing together the sequence of events can be a challenge. Newer videos often explore events that occurred long 
                before older ones, adding to the complexity of the story. This is the definitive unofficial timeline to help you navigate the eras of 
                this fascinating universe. <br><br>
                The World of Walker Timeline is divided into four major Eras, each representing a significant chapter in its rich history:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The Ancient Era (~1000 BC) </li>
                <li> The Modern Era (2015-2030) </li>
                <li>The Dark Era (2030-2090) </li>
                <li>The Future Era (2090-onward) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br>
                Each of these Eras has many important events and characters that add to the meaning of the story. Let's Dive Into It Together.

                <p>The ancient era in the World of Walker lore marks the origin of the storyline, dating back 3,000 years to a highly advanced 
                    civilization called the Walkers (now referred to as the Ancient Walkers). Located in the dense jungles of Vietnam, this 
                    society possessed groundbreaking technology, including the AVI-8 drones and the Spectre, a tool capable of predicting 
                    catastrophic events.

                    The Ancient Walkers used <a href="#">The Spectre</a> to discover two world-changing events. The first was a meteor storm that 
                    would soon destroy their civilization. The second was a massive <a href="events-eleanor.html">solar storm</a> that would 
                    devastate technology for a future civilization—our modern era.

                    Knowing their end was near, they dedicated nearly all their resources to creating time capsules that would preserve their 
                    knowledge and technology. These capsules included two main gifts for future civilizations: the AVI-8 drones and a prophecy 
                    disk. The disks contained messages warning of the dark future to come. In the end, they created eight time capsules and 
                    buried them at locations around the world.

                    The foretold meteor storm arrived, filling the sky with fire. Many Ancient Walkers sought shelter inside Son Doong Cavern. 
                    While most perished in the disaster, a few survived to tell stories of this ancient civilization.

                <h2>Lily's Discovery</h2>
                <h3>2015</h3>
                <p>We first learn of Lily Cadiuex as a passionate archaeology student at a French university, dedicating her free time to researching 
                    “Out of Place Artifacts”—objects that seemed too advanced for their historical time periods. Through her research, she developed a 
                    theory about an ancient civilization dating back to around 1000 BC. However, her professors largely dismissed this idea as implausible. 
                    Undeterred, Lily embarked on fieldwork to find evidence supporting her hypothesis. <br> <br> 
                    Her breakthrough came with the discovery of a unique stone formation found in eight locations around the world, including one site in 
                    northern France. When these locations were connected on a map, they formed a shape resembling the Alan Walker logo. While visiting the 
                    site in France, Lily proved the connection between these stone formations and the theory of an ancient, technologically advanced 
                    civilization. She returned to her university with this new evidence, ultimately convincing her professors to lead an excavation at the 
                    site in northern France. The excavation uncovered compelling proof of the Ancient Walker civilization, propelling Lily into
                    global fame.
